TROUBLESHOOT:

Please ignore LOD errors in the console. Everything works fine and you can just clear the error log.

Please reimport the assets after you've imported the asset pack to your scene. This will generate "thumbnails" for all the assets.

If you have trouble with LODs popping, please add a crossfade shader or adjust the LOD distances in the LOD settings.
